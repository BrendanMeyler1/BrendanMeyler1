- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brendan Meyler I'm a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder and majored in Mathematics with an empasis in computation and a minor in Computer Science. My atypical choice of study gives me the unique advantage of being privy to a wide range of mathematical theory and theeir implications and implementations. 
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the world of CFD and GPU acceleration using CUDA C/C++. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of 1D diffusion equations through self study and implementation. Currently, I am using the lectuares of Lorena Barba's kectures from ME 702 at Boston University. My profile is a living, breathing, window into my current progress of my studies and you are free to examine my code and run them for yourself if you so wish. In approximatley the next 2-3 months I will be adding more feature rich codes which which allows for a more interactive and clear cut experience from the user. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on larger CFD codes and research in an oeffort to develope algorithms which are able to remain accurate and run quickly by leveraging the latest in semiconductor and GPU technology.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at, mebrendan@icloud.com. I am open to those looking to share their advice knowledge, wisdom, and employment oppertunities in the field of Software Engineering and CFD.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I rode my bike across the United States! I'm also a huge nerd when it comes to all things space and semiconductor industry news.
